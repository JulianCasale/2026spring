    <h1>At The End</h1>

    <p>Injury didn’t end the story.</p>
    <p>It rewrote it.</p>
    <p>Led me to new and unfimilar places</p>

    <p>Commitment wasn’t the destination.</p>
    <p>Transfer wasn’t the failure.</p>

    <p>Every line I traveled led somewhere bigger and better.</p>
    <p>Every field shaped who I became.</p>
<p>Although the end goal is no longer football, the leasons learned made it worth while</p>
    <br>
