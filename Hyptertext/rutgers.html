    <h1>Rutgers</h1>

    <p>A transfer.</p>
    <p>A kid with new expectations and wants.</p>

    <p>A bigger and brighter school.</p>
    <p>But theres something missing.</p>
<p>A kid that once though sports were his whole life</p>
    <p>This time, it wasn’t about proving anything.</p>
    <p>It was about choosing where I belonged.</p>
