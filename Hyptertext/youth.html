    <h1>The Early Years</h1>

    <p>Football in the fall. Wrestling in the winter. Baseball in the spring.</p>
    <p>Different seasons - no breaks.</p>
    <p>Friday night lights. Early morning weigh-ins. Dirt stained pants.</p>

    <p>Sports weren’t something I just did.</p>
    <p>They were who I was as a person.</p>

    <br>
